  c_words:
  - I don't remember my name anymore. Just my number.
  - Just get it over with.
  - What's with the stupid mask?
  - I am clean. I am ready.
  - Process me.
  - My mask is fine! It's just dirt!
  - I don't remember my name...
  - The scanner is broken, not me.
  - Stop staring.
  - Just let me through.
  - I dropped my mask running from them. It's just a scratch.
  - The rain smudged my barcode... please, I have nowhere else to go.
  - Don't look at me like that. I'm clean.
  - I found this mask. It fits perfectly.
  - It's just paint on my mask, I swear!
