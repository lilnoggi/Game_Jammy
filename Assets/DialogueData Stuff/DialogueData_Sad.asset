  c_words:
  - They'll eat me....
  - I heard the grinder... is that true?
  - Do they feed us inside? I'm so hungry.
  - Just get it over with.
  - What's with the stupid mask?
  - Please, my daughter is already inside.
  - I am clean. I am ready.
  - Process me.
  - I have no cracks. I am perfect.
  - You look tired, inspector.
  - Please... I haven't eaten in days.
  - I found this mask. It fits perfectly.
  - Don't look at my eyes. Look at the barcode.
  - Just let me through.
  - They are chasing me. Please let me in.
  - I don't remember my name...
  - I have family inside.
  - I am not sick. I promise.
  - Do you smell...burning?
  - The smog... it tastes like copper.
  - Don't send me back to the wasteland.
  - Stop staring.
