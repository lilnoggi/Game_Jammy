  c_words:
  - A crack in the mask doesn't mean I'm sick!
  - I dropped my mask running from them. It's just a scratch.
  - I fell on the way here, I promise!
  - Don't look at me like that. I'm clean.
  - It's just paint on my mask, I swear!
  - I found this mask. It fits perfectly.
  - It's just a small scratch. It doesn't matter!
  - I can work. I swear I can work.
  - I have no cracks. I am perfect.
