  c_words:
  - I dropped my mask running from them. It's just a scratch.
  - My mask is fine! It's just dirt!
  - I fell on the way here, I promise!
  - They are chasing me. Please let me in.
  - It's just a small scratch. It doesn't matter!
  - I am not sick. I promise.
  - It's just paint on my mask, I swear!
  - Don't look at me like that. I'm clean.
