  c_words:
  - We have eradicated hunger. We have eradicated crime. The City is perfection.
  - Yet, we see citizens approaching your desk with... blank faces.
  - Ambivalence is the seed of dissent. A neutral expression hides a treasonous mind.
  - 'New Protocol: Mandatory Joy.'
  - Reject the frowns. But you must also reject the Neutral ones.
  - If they cannot smile for their admission, they do not deserve it.
