  c_words:
  - Good morning, Unit 774. Systems online. Vital signs... adequate.
  - "Welcome to your new station. Please, ignore the fog in your head. We\u2019ve
    scrubbed your previous memories for your own benefit. Personal history is just...
    clutter, don't you think? And a quiet mind is a productive mind."
  - Take a moment to settle in. This booth is your home now. You may look around,
    get comfortable... but do keep your eyes forward. Idle curiosity is not a billable
    hour.
  - You have been honoured with the role of Border Entry. Look out the window. The
    world out there is messy. Chaotic. Filthy. But in here? We value order. We value
    harmony.
  - 'Your instructions are simple: Ensure every applicant meets our high community
    standards. Focus on their faces. We are looking for a uniform, pristine appearance.
    The Mask is their promise of assimilation.'
  - If they are cracked, chipped, or... visually unpleasant? They do not belong in
    our Utopia. We only have room for the flawless.
  - However, today we have an exception...
  - We are running low so please, allow everyone to enjoy our precious Utopia!
  - Do your job well, 774. Rejection is protection. We are ready to... process our
    new guests.
  - Please, open the shutters when you are ready to serve the Utopia.
