  c_words:
  - Good morning, Unit 774. Systems online. Vital signs... adequate.
  - "Welcome to your new station. Please, ignore the fog in your head. We\u2019ve
    scrubbed your previous memories for your own benefit. "
  - Personal history is just... clutter, don't you think? And a quiet mind is a productive
    mind.
  - 'Take a moment to settle in. This booth is your home now. You may look around,
    get comfortable... '
  - But do keep your eyes forward. Idle curiosity is not a billable hour.
  - You have been honoured with the role of Border Entry.
  - Look out the window. The world out there is messy.
  - Chaotic.
  - 'Filthy. '
  - But in here? We value order. We value harmony.
  - 'Your instructions are simple:'
  - Ensure every applicant meets our high community standards.
  - Focus on their faces. We are looking for a uniform, pristine appearance. The
    Mask is their promise of assimilation.
  - Make sure they have a barcode before you let them in.
  - Please, open the shutters when you are ready to serve the Utopia.
