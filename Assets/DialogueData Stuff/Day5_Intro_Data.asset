  c_words:
  - 'Security Alert. Intelligence reports high-level forgeries in circulation. The
    Scanner has been updated to verify digital signatures. '
  - A visual match is no longer sufficient. If the Scanner reads INVALID (Red), the
    applicant is a threat. Deny them immediately.
  - 'Performance Notice. Your hesitation has been noted. Do not let empathy impact
    your yield. The City is hungry for progress. Process them faster. '
  - Remember...
  - We are watching, Inspector.
